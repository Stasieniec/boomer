To start the app, run main.py

All requirements are in requirements.txt

Notes:
When searching for a word, the app first checks the database. If the word is not in there, then it is generated by AI. 
Because of that, searching for words can be slow sometimes (because of the time it takes for the API call to OpenAI)

Internet connection is needed to run this program
